I haven't used Hugo in quite some time, and honestly I've sort of forgotten how to use it.  So I'm just reacquainting myself with the setup in the hope I haven't become completely useless with it.  I'm sure it's fine, Hugo is pretty simple to use, but  I may have forgotten about a quirk or two.

Will soon find out when I commit this post to github!
